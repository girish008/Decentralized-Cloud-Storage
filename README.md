# Decentralized-Cloud-Storage
Achieving Decentralized Resource Protection Mechanism in Cloud Storage


## Introduction
I propose a replacement decentralized access management theme for secure information storage in clouds, that supports anonymous authentication. within the projected theme, the cloud verifies the believability of the user while not knowing the userâ€™s identity before storing information. Our theme conjointly has the additional feature of access management within which solely valid users will decipher to keep data. The theme prevents replay attacks and supports creation, modification, and reading information keep within the cloud. we tend to conjointly address user revocation. Moreover, our authentication and access management theme is decentralized and sturdy, in contrast to alternative access management schemes designed for centralized clouds. The communication, computation, and storage overheads square measure similar to centralized approaches.
